    # for zram swap, most guides reommend the following:
    # swappiness 200, watermark_scale_factor 125, watermark_boost_factor 0

    # watermark_scale_factor
    # This factor controls the aggressiveness of kswapd. It defines the amount
    # of memory left in a node/system before kswapd is woken up and how much
    # memory needs to be free before kswapd goes back to sleep.

    # > What watermark boosting does is try to preemptively fire up kswapd to
    # > free memory when there hasn't been an allocation failure. It does this by
    # > increasing kswapd's high watermark goal and then firing up kswapd. The
    # > reason why this causes freezes is because, with the increased high

    # > order to make forward progress. These processes will, in turn, try to
    # > allocate memory again, which will cause kswapd to steal necessary pages
    # > from those processes again, in a positive feedback loop known as page
    # > thrashing. When page thrashing occurs, your system is essentially
    # > livelocked until the necessary forward progress can be made to stop
    # > processes from trying to continuously allocate memory and trigger kswapd
    # > to steal it back.
